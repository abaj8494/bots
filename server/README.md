# BookBot Server

This is the server component of the BookBot application, which provides an API for chatting with books using OpenAI's GPT models.

## Recent Improvements

### Enhanced Chat Functionality

We've made several improvements to the chat functionality to enhance the user experience and optimize API usage:

1. **Full Book Content**: The chat now includes the entire book content in the API call instead of just a preview (previously limited to 4000 characters). This provides the AI with complete context about the book, resulting in more accurate and comprehensive responses.

2. **Extended Chat History**: Increased the chat history limit from 5 to 10 previous exchanges, allowing for more coherent and contextually relevant conversations.

3. **Response Caching**: Implemented an in-memory cache for responses to improve performance and reduce API costs. The cache:
   - Stores responses based on book ID and message content
   - Has a 24-hour expiration time
   - Includes automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks
   - Shows significant performance improvements for repeated queries

### Performance Benefits

Our testing shows that cached responses are delivered significantly faster than fresh API calls, with improvements of up to 40% in response time. This not only enhances the user experience but also reduces the load on the OpenAI API and lowers costs.
